      <h3><u>All About Me</u><h3>
        <p>My name is Naomi Almestica, and I am a Game and Interactive Design Major.
          I love drawing and video games most of all.
          This project was about showing the world what my quarantine has been like so far.
          Each image in my gallery is something that helped me get through it all.</p>
